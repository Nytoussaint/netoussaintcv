# Nyya Emmanuel Toussaint

## ABOUT ME
I hold heritage from Haiti and North Carolina. I am a Ph.D. student in History at Florida International University, researching Black religion, food, and music as core components of Pan-Africanism and Négritude in the Caribbean and U.S. South low-country regions. I am a graduate of [Union Theological Seminary](https://utsnyc.edu), [The New School](thenewschool.edu), and [Florida International University](fiu.edu). 

I am a founding member and the Creative Director of [Lanbi ak Manchèt](instagram.com/lanbiakmanchet], an online cultural and spiritual organizing hub committed to social advocacy and liberation. Hundreds of people have gathered for my public programs on Caribbean culture and spirituality, and the recorded events have garnered thousands of playbacks. I am also the lead creator of Duolingo’s Haitian Creole course for English speakers. I serve as a board member of KOSANBA – Association of Vodou Studies and is a member of the Haitian Studies Association and the Political Theology Network.
